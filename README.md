A 2-D local multiplayer artillery game similar to Team17's Worms. It features a fully destructible and randomly generated terrain powered by Perlin Noise that 25 units can battle inside.

Disclaimer
----------

This project was done as part of a programming project course at LiU, and was one of the first games we ever made. Looking back at the code makes us want to puke, but it was one of the first "real" programming projects after our basic C++ programming course, so we're still proud of what we were able to accomplish back then. It still builds and runs OK after 6 years with no updates to the original source code. I would also highly recommend you to turn down you volume to 10% or something when launching the game, as the music is VERY loud on game startup.

Libraries
---------

For the project we used [SFML 2.1](https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML) and [Reputeless Perlin Noise](https://github.com/Reputeless/PerlinNoise) library. We've written everything else.
